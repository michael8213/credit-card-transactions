In this project i will analyze transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by european cardholders,
I will use jupyter notebook and python to preform manipulations on data,
This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions,
Feature 'Time' contains the seconds elapsed between each transaction and the first transaction in the dataset,
The feature 'Amount' is the transaction Amount, this feature can be used for example-dependant cost-senstive learning,
Feature 'Class' is the response variable and it takes value 1 in case of fraud and 0 otherwise.
